- yes, as part of the workflow, I'd like to keep a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly log of Claude activities, whever claude does an activity, it should go on the daily log ( for whatever context, Planetary, Plainsight, Wishare.. ) and log the activity there: "For Planetary on DTF: Worked on ticket XYZ about ABC.. problem...process..result", i'd go then and summary those weekly and monthly, that will also help me keep track of my work on a larger level
