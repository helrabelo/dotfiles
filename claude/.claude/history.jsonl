Ylana ama moda e criatividade, hel adora fotografia e tecnologia. Ambos são bastante dedicados na musculação e corrida. Nosso relacionamento é leve, tranquilo, vivemos o nosso universo particular. Tem o que as pessoas sabem de nos, tem o que elas veem de nos, e tem o que nos temos entre nos. E o que nos temos entre nos é muito maior. \n\nnos conhecemos pelo tinder, dia 06 de Janeiro de 2023 trocamos nossa primeira mensagem no Whatsapp. \n\nNosso primeiro encontro seria dia 13/01/2023, pois a Ylana estava viajando com a familia e durante toda a semana nos falamos pelo whatsapp. Dia 13 tive um imprevisto, acabou que saimos no dia 14, um almoço + Cinema,  fomos no Casa Fontana e em seguida assistir Avatar: O caminho da água, Sala Vip F11 e F12, a noite foi ótima.\n\nNos vimos constantemente depois disso, duas, tres vezes por semana. Ylana fazia questão de dar indiretas porque ela não faria o convite, tinha que partir de mim. Fomos a restaurantes, cafés, cinemas. Em um desses encontros tive mal da barriga e precisei cancelar, e então ela me fez a surpresa de ir lá em casa e me levou remédios e um chá. Um gesto lindo, nunca esqueci, na hora hora ja sabia \"é ela\". Nessa época que a Linda começou a fazer parte da minha vida, autista, mongol e perfeita desde sempre.\n\nLogo logo namoramos, viajamos dia 24/02 pra Guaramiranga, uma casa linda, um visual magnifico, super rustica e reclusa. A minha intenção era fazer um jantar no sábado 25/02 e preparar algo especial, mas no sábado pela manhã 25/02 a pedi assim que acordamos, não deu pra segurar haha passamos o resto da viagem comendo bem, tomando vinho, ouvindo musica e vendo besteiras no netflix. Foi otimo\n\nNa semana seguinte, a Cacao veio ao mundo, nosso 2 pet. Levamos ela pra casa alguns dias deopis, no comecinho de março. \n\nPassamos a virada do ano 2023/2024 já morando juntos, ficamos no apartamento que alugava na epoca, onde foi a primeira casa que morei sozinho. \n\nNa comemoração de 1 ano, fiz uma surpresa em casa, com varios baloes, rosas e um café da manhã incrivel. Também dei excelenets presentes caros. \n\nEm meados de Fev/Mar, a nossa Linda deu a luz a 4 pets, 2 deles acabaram expandindo a nossa familia, Oliver e Olivia, agora sendo 4 pets. O ylana doida, olha no que ela meteu a gente.. que loucura 4 pets\n\nEm outubro de 2024, comemoramos nosso aniversario juntos num almoço super especial no Mangue Azul, um dos melhores e mais exclusivos restaurantes da cidade, era também nosso favorito. Se não tivesse fechado, nosso casamento com certeza seria la\n\nComo presente pra gente, fizemos uma viagem ao Rio de Janeiro e Búzios.

O ylana doida, olha no que ela meteu a gente.. que loucura 4 pets\n\nNessa época, desde Setembro 2023, na verdade, estávamos secretamente comprando nosso apartamento. É um apartamento que sonhava em morar desde minha faculdade, quando ia de bicicleta e passava na frente todos os dias. Nunca tive duvidas de que um dia teria condições de prover isso pra minha familia. Era só questão de tempo, pois sempre trabalhei duro. Nos mudamos em meados de março de 2024.\n\nEm outubro de 2024, comemoramos nosso aniversario juntos num almoço super especial no Mangue Azul, um dos melhores e mais exclusivos restaurantes da cidade, era também nosso favorito. Se não tivesse fechado, nosso casamento com certeza seria la\n\nComo presente pra gente, fizemos uma viagem ao Rio de Janeiro e Búzios.

Esperamos sempre poder ter isso em nossas vidas.\n\nTivemos nosso 2 ano novo em casa, mas dessa vez NOSSA casa, NOSSA, nao alugada. Foi muito especial.\n\nO ano de 2025 começou com muito trabalho, mas durante março-abr-maio ylana passou por um processo de congelamento de ovulos, ja pensando no futuro e nossa familia, ja que ela tem 34 anos. E eu muito dedicado no emprego pra ganhar dinheiro e poder dar uma boa qualidade de vida a nossa familia\n\nNessa epoca fizemos uma viagem a sao paulo pra ylana tirar o visto, minha ideia secreta era fazer uma viagem em out 2025 pro nosso aniversario, seria pra NY, iria pedi-la em noivado la. Porém a viagem de sao paulo foi frustrante, ylana sob os efeitos dos hormonios de congelamento de ovulos, o visto foi negado, os passeios nao foram bons. Um fracasso.\n\nNão me dando por vencido, organizei uma viagem para Icarai de Amontada, em agosto, passamos um feriado longo la. Fomos na sexta pela manha e voltamos na segunda. \n\nFoi uma viagem muito especial, fizemos passeios, comemos nos melhores restaurantes, tiramos muitas fotoss, e o mais importante: dia 30 de agosto foi o pedido. Organizei uma bela surpresa, um jantar customizado no nosso proprio quarto. A equipe do hotel me ajudou a convnecer a ylana que na verdade teriamos um jantar especial no restaurante do hotel, e enquanto aguardavamos eles prepararam nossa suite com nosso jantar. Me desculpei com ela falando que precisava ir ao quarto, preparei as cameras, peguei o anel, liguei pra ela e a chamei para o quarto\n\nAo entrar, ela ficou maravilhada com a surpresa, mas nem imaginava o que estava por vir, fiz uma declaração de amor bem romantica, me ajoelhei e pedi sua mao em casamento. Ela aceitou e tivemos uma noite incrivel. No outro dia relaxamos no hotel, vinho, boa comida e encerramos a viagem com um jantar a luz de velas na praia, exlcusivo so pra gente, foi perfeito.\n\n","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759152402399,"project":"/Users/helrabelo"}

Podemos usar nossos melhores agentes para pensar numa nova estrutura para homepage que contemple nossa história.\n\npodemos daí deixar separado apenas a pagina de /convite, /rsvp, /informacoes e /presentes. EM /informacoes teriamos uma página breve e resumida com as informações mais importantes: Dia, Hora, Traje, Local, Cronograma e outros detalhes.\n\ne daí pensei em alguma features:\n\nJá que planejamos que nossos convidados interajam, precisamos nos resguardar de potenciais atores maliciosos. Então vamos fazer dos nossos convidados usuários no supabase, \n\nAssim, podemos utilizar do próprio supabase para enviar os emails de Convite. De toda forma, precisaremos de uma feature em /admin para CONVIDAR usuários ( mais jovens, que saibam usar email e sejam capazes de clicar no link e criar uma conta ), assim como CRIAR usuários, para que possamos adicionar pessoas como nossos Avós, Tios e Crianças. Assim, os usuários poderão interagir com nosso site, enviar fotos, vídeos, fazerem comentários e etc\n\ntambém gostaria de ter uma tabela de \"Profiles\", colocaria o meu perfil, da minha esposa, dos nossos pais, irmãos e nossos 4 pets, pode vir a ser útil em alguns components e assim poderíamos colocar fotos dos nossos pets e centralizar suas informações\n\ndaí podemos usar nossos melhores agentes para pensar na hierarquia de informações da homepage, podemos considerar que temos um bucket de imagens/videos no supabase, inclusive temos várias fotos e vídeos lá\n\npodemos criar components que serão geridos em /admin, como Heroes, Gallerys e etc e apenas add os assets para que possam ser mostrados nos components. \n\nPodemos, sim, considerar ter um floating button para o RSVP \n\nPodemos considerar features de convidados  add comentários em presentes, galerias/fotos ( não precisam ser todas, obvio, apenas em algumas que façam sentido ), convidados add fotos e videos\n\nGostaría de substituir a tag line \"o que temos entre nós é muito maior do que podem imaginar\", isso veio porque no prompt inicial eu falei sobre nossa história, sobre como somos reservados e introvertidos, sobre como somos \"menos\" de nós com os outros. Tem o que as pessoas pensam de nós, o que elas vêem de nós e o que nós temos entre nós. E o que temos entre nós é muito maior e mais profundo pois conseguirmos ser 100% nós mesmos e viver nosso próprio universo particular. Então acho que a tag pode ser algo mais nesse sentido, \"temos nosso universo particular\", mas por favor fica a vontade pra pensar em algo mais legal se voce conseguir\n\nquanto aos guidelines de UI/UX, eu to de boas em cortar pra 2 fontes principais, gostamos muito da https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond, e pras cores, no convite estamos usando essas:\n#fbfaf8 #f5f5f3 #fbfaf6 #f9f9f9 #f7f6f2 e #000. Adoramos essa paleta de cores, mas é totalmente compreensível que fiquem OK num convite, mas não sejam apropriadas para um website ( por UI/UX e accessibilidade reasons ), então podemos nos inspirar nelas para criar uma paleta de cores pro site, desde que se mantenham nessa linha very soft-light-green/pale pastel com detalhes de SVG botanicos\n\nvamos lembrar que o foco de UI/UX é o mobile-first, a MAIORIA dos usuários vao utilizar por lá.\n\num último detalhe, e que não deixa de ser importante. Somos muito apegado a caussas sociais, então gostariamos de colocar um espaço no nosso site encorajando nossos convidados a se juntarem a nós e contribuirem com um abrigo para cães. Gostaria de deixar as informações de doação para o abrigo, e também gostaria de deixar, em um lugar apropriado e também na pagina da lista de presents uma mensagem falando sobre como eu e a ylana nos sentimos abençoados e privilegiados por poder utilizar nosso casamento como um meio para ajudar animais, que são, pra nós pais de 4 pets, criaturas que precisam de toda ajuda, apoio e amor. Gostariamos de comunicar que não precisamos de nada, mas como sabemos que nossos convidados gostariam de contribuir materialmente conosco, disponibilizamos a lista de presentes, porém, como gesto de gratidão nossa ao mundo, estamos lançando essa campanha encorajando todos os convidados, os que se sentem tocados a dar um presente ou não, que também contribuam com pelo menos 1 saco de ração ( esse será um dos presentes ), e nós, Hel e Ylana, dobraremos a quantidade. Todos os alimentos serão doados ao lar Tin Tin (https://www.instagram.com/lartintin/?hl=en) Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)\nAnimais que foram resgatados vítimas de maus tratos, deficientes e com doenças crônicas.\nPix: 734.920.866-91 Viviane de Lima.

Introduction\nThis document outlines a feature request for a tool to help partners visualize and debug the outputs of the webvis filter. The primary goal is to provide a clear and intuitive way to understand the data flow and transformation through the chain of filters, from videoIn to webvis, and to present the subject data in a more readable and actionable format. This could either be a standalone HTML page or a webpage behind a COR’s enabled server or behind a webserver transparently proxying requests to the filter pipeline  \n2. Problem Statement\nCurrently, understanding and debugging the output of the Webvis filter, and the intermediate data generated by the preceding filters, can be challenging for partners. The raw subject data may not be easily interpretable, hindering the ability to quickly identify issues or validate the intended behavior of the filter chain.\n3. Proposed Solution\nWe propose developing a visualization and debugging tool that offers the following capabilities:\n3.1. Synchronized Video and Subject Data Display\nThe tool should display the output video from the Webvis filter alongside the subject data generated across the chain of filters. This synchronized view will allow partners to correlate visual information with the corresponding data at each stage of processing.\n3.2. Enhanced Subject Data Readability\nThe subject data should be rendered in a more readable and user-friendly format. This could involve:\n\nStructured Views: Presenting data in organized tables, trees, or other structured formats.\nHighlighting Key Information: Emphasizing important fields or values.\nFiltering and Sorting: Allowing partners to filter and sort the subject data to focus on specific aspects.\n3.3. Video Annotation Capabilities\nThe tool should support various video annotation functionalities based on the subject data:\n3.3.1. Bounding Boxes and Confidence Scores\nFor use cases involving object detection or tracking, the tool should be able to overlay bounding boxes on the video, along with their corresponding confidence scores, based on the subject data. This will enable partners to visually verify the accuracy of detection and tracking algorithms.\n3.3.2. Inference Classification Annotation\nFor use cases involving classification tasks, the tool should be able to annotate the video with the results of inference, such as class labels or probabilities, derived from the subject data. This will provide immediate visual feedback on the classification performance.\n4. Benefits\nImproved Debugging: Partners can quickly identify and diagnose issues within the filter chain by visually inspecting the data and its impact on the video.\nFaster Development Cycles: Reduced time spent on debugging will accelerate the development and integration of new features.\nEnhanced Understanding: A clear visualization of data flow will lead to a better understanding of how filters transform information.\nValidation of Filter Logic: Partners can easily validate that the filters are behaving as expected and producing the desired outputs.\nBetter Partner Experience: A more intuitive and powerful tool will improve the overall experience for partners working with the webvis filter.\n\n\n\ngiven I'm the only senior frontend engineer here, what can I assess from this document?\n\ndo I need more details? what can I do from here?

My parents were poor-mid class, they gave everything they had so that I at least had good education. I was always a good student and always had a lot of ambition. I did not have support and I did not understand how to leverage that early in young years, probably wasted my 18s-25s looking for shortcuts.\n\nOne day, I've decided to start taking my life serious and ever since them I've dedicated myself to be better. I've worked harder, ate better, got to study, everything.\n\nI've been through some bad shit in my life, lots of them. And I've never really understood why, and I've never really cared. I just wanted to bulldoze it, get \"to the other side\", \"be successful\" no matter what. I was never in the moment, I was always thinking \"i need to get that to be happy\", and then it was \"that other thing\", and once got that, then \"on to the next\"\n\nI think now I understand that everything. All the difficulties, all the sacrifice, I think that was just god testing me, hardening me. I've wanted to be strong, I've wanted to be successful. So he gave me difficult things to do, hard things to do. And now I understand that everything I've been through was just God preparing me for this moment. Getting married, starting a family. In the house I've always wanted. With the person I've always dreamt of. For the first time I do not want to get to the next thing. For the first time, now I just want it to never go away, and to stay here, live here, forever. With her. With us.\n\nSee? I can be pretty deep, most introverts can. \n\nBut I'm also very sarcastic and playful. I'd probably break jokes about my dogs, and how Ylana gave me no choice but to accept that a devil like Cacao lives under my roof and that I actually have to pay for her to live here. And that's not even the worst part, I even have to clean her shit. Like literally.. I DO now understand how marriages are though, you know? The things you have to do for your partner..  ( thats a sarcarstic joke because Cacao is a 1 pound german spitz that's completely harmless, although VERY louc, oof )\n\n\n\nanyway, I think I've shown most of my writing, and I've even gave a very sentimental, deep and sincere facts about me and my life\n\nplease do a good job!","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1760187042553,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/personal/thousanddaysoflove"}

Read WEEK_2_SUMMARY.md and CLIENT_PORTAL_V2_TODO.md\n     to understand what we've done and what's next.\n     ```\n\n     ---\n\n     ## Context\n\n     - **Branch:** `feature/portal-v2-foundation` (continuing)\n     - **Weeks Completed:** Week 1 (Foundation), Week 2 (Core Layout)\n     - **Current Focus:** Week 3 - Navigation & State\n\n     ---\n\n     ## What's Already Done\n\n     ### Week 1 ✅\n     - `/src/v2` and `/src/shared` directory structure\n     - Design system migration (theme, semantic tokens)\n     - Auth utilities migration\n     - Standard components migration\n     - Zero TypeScript errors\n\n     ### Week 2 ✅\n     - AppShell layout component\n     - Collapsible sidebar (64px ↔ 280px)\n     - Topbar with global actions\n     - Mobile drawer navigation\n     - Sidebar state management with localStorage\n     - Demo route at `/v2-demo`\n\n     ---\n\n     ## Week 3 Goals\n\n     ### 1. Nested Routing\n     - Configure TanStack Router for org/project/pipeline hierarchy\n     - Set up route guards and auth checks\n     - Implement breadcrumb navigation\n     - Handle 404 and error routes\n\n     ### 2. Sidebar Navigation Tree\n     - Expandable project tree component\n     - Favorites section\n     - Recents section\n     - Active state indicators\n     - Tree expand/collapse state\n\n     ### 3. State Management\n     - Navigation state store (Zustand)\n     - Filters state store (Zustand)\n     - Enhance existing stores as needed\n     - React Query for server state (if needed)\n\n     ---\n\n     ## Technical Prep\n\n     ### Review Existing Router Setup\n     - Current router: TanStack Router v7\n     - Route structure: `/src/config/routes/`\n     - Route patterns: Already has org/project structure\n\n     ### Key Files to Reference\n     - `/src/config/routes/index.ts` - Main route tree\n     - `/src/config/routes/organization.routes.ts` - Org routing patterns\n     - `/src/config/routes/project.routes.ts` - Project routing patterns\n     - `/src/v2/stores/sidebarStore.ts` - Example Zustand store pattern\n\n     ### Navigation Tree Requirements\n     1. **Hierarchical Structure:**\n        - Organizations (top level)\n        - Projects (under orgs)\n        - Pipelines (under projects)\n        - Models (under projects)\n\n     2. **Interactive Features:**\n        - Expand/collapse project nodes\n        - Click to navigate to resource\n        - Show active/selected state\n        - Highlight current route\n\n     3. **Quick Access:**\n        - Favorites (starred items)\n        - Recents (recently viewed)\n        - Persistent expand/collapse state\n\n     ---\n\n     ## Success Criteria\n\n     Week 3 is complete when:\n     - ✅ Can navigate between org/project/pipeline views via sidebar\n     - ✅ URL structure reflects hierarchy (e.g.,\n     `/orgs/:orgId/projects/:projectId/pipelines/:pipelineId`)\n     - ✅ Breadcrumbs show current location in hierarchy\n     - ✅ Navigation tree expands/collapses and persists state\n     - ✅ Active route is highlighted in sidebar\n     - ✅ Favorites and recents sections are functional\n     - ✅ Route guards prevent unauthorized access\n     - ✅ 404 and error pages handle invalid routes\n     - ✅ Zero TypeScript errors\n\n     ---\n\n     ## Implementation Strategy\n\n     ### Phase 1: Routing (Day 1-2)\n     1. Create v2 route structure for orgs/projects/pipelines\n     2. Add route guards and auth middleware\n     3. Build breadcrumb component\n     4. Implement 404 and error pages\n\n     ### Phase 2: Navigation Tree (Day 2-3)\n     1. Create navigation tree data structure\n     2. Build TreeNode component (expandable)\n     3. Build ProjectTree component\n     4. Add active state indicators\n     5. Implement click handlers for navigation\n\n     ### Phase 3: Quick Access (Day 3-4)\n     1. Build Favorites section\n     2. Build Recents section\n     3. Add favorites/recents state management\n     4. Implement add/remove favorites\n     5. Track recently viewed items\n\n     ### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Day 4-5)\n     1. Persist tree expand/collapse state\n     2. Add loading states\n     3. Add empty states\n     4. Write unit tests\n     5. Visual testing and bug fixes\n\n     ---\n\n     ## Component Structure to Build\n\n     ```\n     src/v2/\n     ├── components/\n     │   ├── navigation/\n     │   │   ├── NavigationTree.tsx      # Main tree container\n     │   │   ├── TreeNode.tsx            # Individual expandable node\n     │   │   ├── ProjectTree.tsx         # Project hierarchy\n     │   │   ├── FavoritesSection.tsx    # Favorites quick access\n     │   │   ├── RecentsSection.tsx      # Recently viewed\n     │   │   └── index.ts\n     │   ├── breadcrumbs/\n     │   │   ├── Breadcrumbs.tsx         # Breadcrumb navigation\n     │   │   └── index.ts\n     │   └── ...

{"display":"lets review week 5 progress again after:\nWeek 5 Progress\n\n  - Built the persistent global-search stack: a lightweight store plus indexer turn the navigation\n    tree into a scored corpus (src/v2/stores/searchStore.ts:1, src/v2/services/search.ts:1).\n    The new useSearch hook wires that data into the Cmd+K experience with navigation recents\n    (src/v2/hooks/useSearch.ts:1), and the Search modal/input/results components provide\n    debounced filtering, keyboard navigation, and recent-search chips (src/v2/components/search/\n    SearchModal.tsx:21, src/v2/components/search/SearchInput.tsx:1, src/v2/components/search/\n    SearchResults.tsx:1).\n  - Added a reusable keyboard-shortcut registry (src/v2/services/keyboardShortcuts.ts:1) and hook\n    (src/v2/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts:1). V2LayoutOutlet now registers Cmd/Ctrl + K plus the\n    “g → o/p” sequences and renders the shared modals (src/v2/pages/V2LayoutOutlet.tsx:1), so\n    shortcuts work from anywhere inside the v2 shell.\n  - Replaced the placeholder search button with a full-width trigger and unread notifications\n    badge in the top bar (src/v2/components/Topbar.tsx:33), keeping the experience consistent on\n    desktop/mobile.\n  - Delivered the notifications panel end‑to‑end: new notification types and store with read/\n    unread persistence (src/v2/types/notification.ts:1, src/v2/stores/notificationsStore.ts:1), a\n    polling service with mock fallback and grouping helpers (src/v2/services/notifications.ts:1),\n    the useNotifications hook that ties React Query to the panel state (src/v2/hooks/\n    useNotifications.ts:1), and the panel/item UI with filtering, “mark all read”, and\n    navigation integration (src/v2/components/notifications/NotificationsPanel.tsx:1, src/\n    v2/components/notifications/NotificationItem.tsx:1). The panel mounts alongside the other\n    global modals (src/v2/pages/V2LayoutOutlet.tsx:55), and the Topbar bell opens it with data-\n    testid=\"notifications-button\".\n  - Added focused unit coverage for the new data layers: search scoring (src/v2/services/\n    __tests__/search.test.ts:1) and notification grouping (src/v2/services/__tests__/\n    notifications.test.ts:1).\n\n  Tests\n\n  - npm run test -- src/v2/services/__tests__/search.test.ts (fails under the repo’s current Node\n    v16.15.1: Vite/Vitest import node:fs/promises’s constants, which Node <17.3 doesn’t export.\n    Upgrade to Node ≥18 (matching Vite 6’s requirement) and re-run to execute both the search and\n    notifications suites.)\n\n  Next Steps\n\n  1. Point fetchNotificationFeed at the real backend endpoint or EventSource once it’s available\n     so the panel shows live production data instead of the mock fallback.\n  2. Extend the shortcut registry to cover / focus and ? help once those panels exist, and\n     continue with the remaining Week‑5 items (settings modal, performance/code-splitting, etc.).\n\nfix ts errrros\nsrc/v2/components/notifications/NotificationsPanel.tsx:151:21 - error TS2322: Type '(notification: PortalNotification & { isRead: boolean; }) => void' is not assignable to type '(notification: PortalNotification) => void'.\n  Types of parameters 'notification' and 'notification' are incompatible.\n    Type 'PortalNotification' is not assignable to type 'PortalNotification & { isRead: boolean; }'.\n      Property 'isRead' is missing in type 'PortalNotification' but required in type '{ isRead: boolean; }'.\n\n151                     onSelect={handleSelect}\n                        ~~~~~~~~\n\n  src/v2/components/notifications/NotificationsPanel.tsx:67:62\n    67   const handleSelect = (notification: PortalNotification & { isRead: boolean }) => {\n                                                                    ~~~~~~\n    'isRead' is declared here.\n  src/v2/components/notifications/NotificationItem.tsx:39:3\n    39   onSelect?: (notification: PortalNotification) => void;\n         ~~~~~~~~\n    The expected type comes from property 'onSelect' which is declared here on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & NotificationItemProps'\n\nsrc/v2/components/notifications/NotificationsPanel.tsx:152:21 - error TS2322: Type '(notification: PortalNotification & { isRead: boolean; }, nextState: boolean) => void' is not assignable to type '(notification: PortalNotification, nextState: boolean) => void'.\n  Types of parameters 'notification' and 'notification' are incompatible.\n    Type 'PortalNotification' is not assignable to type 'PortalNotification & { isRead: boolean; }'.\n      Property 'isRead' is missing in type 'PortalNotification' but required in type '{ isRead: boolean; }'.\n\n152                     onToggleRead={handleToggleRead}\n                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  src/v2/components/notifications/NotificationsPanel.tsx:77:66\n    77   const handleToggleRead = (notification: PortalNotification & { isRead: boolean }, nextState: boolean) => {\n                                                                        ~~~~~~\n    'isRead' is declared here.\n  src/v2/components/notifications/NotificationItem.tsx:40:3\n    40   onToggleRead?: (notification: PortalNotification, nextState: boolean) => void;\n         ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    The expected type comes from property 'onToggleRead' which is declared here on type 'IntrinsicAttributes & NotificationItemProps'\n\n\nFound 2 errors in the same file, starting at: src/v2/components/notifications/NotificationsPanel.tsx:151","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1762715917427,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight","sessionId":"dcdb3eed-1733-4135-9720-3aad5342a466"}

Create `SettingsModal` component\n2. Add tabs/sections:\n   - Theme preferences (light/dark mode)\n   - Keyboard shortcuts customization\n   - Notification preferences (enable/disable types)\n   - Display preferences (sidebar default state, etc.)\n3. Create `useSettings` hook\n4. Create `settingsStore.ts` with Zustand + localStorage\n5. Add settings icon/button to Topbar\n6. Persist all settings\n7. Write unit tests\n\n**Files to Create:**\n```\nsrc/v2/components/settings/\n├── SettingsModal.tsx          # Main modal with tabs\n├── ThemeSettings.tsx           # Theme preferences\n├── ShortcutSettings.tsx        # Keyboard customization\n├── NotificationSettings.tsx    # Notification preferences\n└── index.ts\n\nsrc/v2/hooks/\n└── useSettings.ts              # Settings hook\n\nsrc/v2/stores/\n└── settingsStore.ts            # Settings persistence\n\nsrc/v2/__tests__/components/\n└── SettingsModal.test.tsx      # Unit tests\n```\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n```tsx\n// settingsStore.ts interface\ninterface SettingsState {\n  theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';\n  sidebarDefaultCollapsed: boolean;\n  notificationsEnabled: {\n    system: boolean;\n    project: boolean;\n    pipeline: boolean;\n    run: boolean;\n  };\n  keyboardShortcuts: Record<string, string>; // Allow customization\n  // ... other preferences\n}\n\n// SettingsModal.tsx structure\n<Modal>\n  <Tabs>\n    <TabList>\n      <Tab>Theme</Tab>\n      <Tab>Shortcuts</Tab>\n      <Tab>Notifications</Tab>\n      <Tab>Display</Tab>\n    </TabList>\n    <TabPanels>\n      {/* Each settings section */}\n    </TabPanels>\n  </Tabs>\n  <ModalFooter>\n    <Button onClick={resetToDefaults}>Reset to Defaults</Button>\n    <Button onClick={onClose}>Close</Button>\n  </ModalFooter>\n</Modal>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Priority 2: Code Splitting & Performance (Day 1-2)\n\n**Goal:** Reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Add `React.lazy` to all dashboard pages\n2. Add Suspense boundaries with loading states\n3. Measure bundle size before/after\n4. Add virtualization to RunHistoryTable (react-window or react-virtual)\n5. Optimize images with lazy loading\n6.

Use virtual scrolling for large datasets (1000+ items)\n   - Consider react-window or @tanstack/react-virtual\n\n2. **Filtering:**\n   - Debounce filter changes (150ms)\n   - Use memoization for filtered results\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - Lazy load pipeline details on selection\n   - Cache comparison results\n\n4. **Creation Wizard:**\n   - Auto-save drafts every 30s\n   - Persist to localStorage\n   - Clear on successful creation\n\n---\n\n## UI/UX Patterns\n\n### Empty States\n- Pipeline list: \"No pipelines found. Create your first pipeline.\"\n- Filters: \"No pipelines match your filters. Clear filters.\"\n- Comparison: \"Select 2-4 pipelines to compare.\"\n\n### Loading States\n- Pipeline list: Skeleton rows (5-10)\n- Wizard: Spinner on form submission\n- Comparison: Skeleton columns\n\n### Error States\n- List loading error: \"Failed to load pipelines. Retry\"\n- Creation error: Inline field errors + summary at top\n- Comparison error: \"Failed to load pipeline data. Try again.\"\n\n---\n\n## Files to Reference\n\n1. **CLIENT_PORTAL_V2_TODO.md** - Overall project tracker\n2. **WEEK_4_SUMMARY.md** - Pipeline controls implementation\n3. **WEEK_5_PROMPT.md** - Original Week 5 goals\n4. **src/v2/components/pipelines/** - Existing pipeline components\n5. **src/hooks/api/usePipelines.ts** - API integration patterns\n6. **src/components/notifications/useNotificationCenter.ts** - Notification patterns\n\n---\n\n## Ready to Start!\n\nCopy the \"Quick Start\" prompt above to begin Week 6! 🚀\n\nWe'll complete the pipeline management features that were planned for Week 5\nand create a production-ready pipeline interface with comprehensive CRUD operations.\n","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1762719218075,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight","sessionId":"89f2f5ef-4620-431f-af14-745bbb382bb1"}

{"display":"  Continue Week 6 - Fix Remaining TypeScript Errors\n\n  I've completed fixing all icon imports in the Week 6 Client Portal v2 pipeline components\n  (10 files total), successfully converting from lucide-react to react-icons/fi. Now I need to\n   fix the remaining TypeScript errors to complete Week 6.\n\n  Current Errors to Fix (33 total in 9 files):\n\n  1. Missing notification center imports (4 occurrences)\n\n  - The import path @/components/notifications/useNotificationCenter doesn't exist\n  - Need to check if this exists elsewhere or create it\n\n  2. Router configuration issues\n\n  - All /v2/ routes are not recognized by TanStack Router\n  - Routes like /v2/$organizationId/$projectId/pipelines need to be added to router config\n\n  3. Unused imports to clean up\n\n  - Remove unused useDisclosure, ButtonGroup, FiUpload, etc.\n\n  4. Type mismatches\n\n  - organizationId vs organization_id property names\n  - useProjects hook expecting no arguments but receiving organizationId\n  - Filter type mismatch (optional vs required organizationId)\n\n  5. Missing hooks\n\n  - @/hooks/useDebounce not found\n\n  Please:\n\n  1. First, check if the notification center exists at a different path or if we need to\n  create a mock/stub\n  2. Add the v2 routes to the router configuration\n  3. Clean up all unused imports\n  4. Fix the type mismatches and hook issues\n  5. Build the project to verify all errors are resolved\n  6. Update the main TODO file at\n  /Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight/CLIENT_PORTAL_V2_TODO.md with:\n    - Mark Week 6 as COMPLETE (100%)\n    - Update overall progress statistics\n    - Note what was accomplished\n\n  Week 6 Current Status:\n\n  - ✅ Pipeline list with sorting, filtering, pagination (100%)\n  - ✅ Pipeline creation wizard with 4 steps (100%)\n  - ✅ Bulk actions for pipeline management (100%)\n  - ✅ All icon imports fixed (lucide-react → react-icons/fi)\n  - 🔧 TypeScript errors need fixing (33 remaining)\n  - ⏳ Pipeline comparison feature (not started - optional)\n\n  Once errors are fixed:\n\n  The Week 6 pipeline management features will be fully complete and functional. We can then\n  either:\n  1. Implement the pipeline comparison feature (bonus)\n  2. Move on to Week 7 of the development plan\n\n  Please start by investigating the notification center import path issue since it appears in\n  multiple files.","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1762726087682,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight","sessionId":"6756430b-1843-407d-bb4b-b1ad2be075aa"}

{"display":"  Simplify Week 6 Pipeline UI to Match Backend Reality\n\n  Context\n\n  The Week 6 pipeline UI was built based on incorrect assumptions about the backend API\n  capabilities. It implements a full pipeline orchestration system (start/stop controls, runs\n  tracking, config builder, triggers) but the actual backend only provides simple CRUD\n  operations for managing BigQuery data collection pipelines.\n\n  Current State\n\n  Backend Reality (plainsight-api)\n\n  Filter pipelines are data containers that:\n  - Create BigQuery datasets for storing CloudEvents from external filters\n  - Accept event ingestion via POST /filter-pipelines/{id}/events\n  - Support basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)\n  - Auto-generate BigQuery dataset names\n  - Validate CloudEvents with required extensions: pipelineid, filtername, filtertopic\n\n  Available API Endpoints:\n  GET  /filter-pipelines?project={id}           // List pipelines (optionally by project)\n  POST /filter-pipelines                         // Create pipeline\n  GET  /filter-pipelines/{id_or_name}            // Get pipeline\n  PATCH /filter-pipelines/{id}                   // Update description only\n  DELETE /filter-pipelines/{id}?delete_dataset   // Delete pipeline + optional dataset\n  POST /filter-pipelines/{id_or_name}/events     // Ingest CloudEvents\n  GET  /filter-pipelines/{id}/dataset/validate   // Check BigQuery access\n\n  FilterPipeline Schema (from backend):\n  type FilterPipeline struct {\n    id: UUID\n    organization_id: UUID\n    project_id: UUID\n    name: string                    // immutable after creation\n    description: string\n    bigquery_dataset: string        // auto-generated, read-only\n    created_by: UUID\n    created_at: timestamp\n    updated_at: timestamp\n    deleted_at: timestamp | null\n  }\n\n  FilterPipelineCreate:\n  {\n    name: string           // 1-100 chars, becomes URL-friendly slug\n    description?: string   // 0-500 chars\n    project_id: UUID\n  }\n\n  FilterPipelineUpdate:\n  {\n    description?: string   // Only field that can be updated\n  }\n\n  Week 6 Frontend (client-portal)\n\n  Files that need updating:\n\n  1. src/v2/hooks/usePipelineCreation.ts ✅ Already updated to use filterPipelineCreate() and\n  filterPipelineUpdate()\n  2. src/v2/hooks/api/usePipelineActions.ts ✅ Already updated to use filterPipelineDelete()\n  3. src/v2/hooks/api/usePipelines.ts ❌ Still using non-existent endpoints\n  4. src/v2/types/pipeline.ts ❌ Complex types don't match backend\n  5. src/v2/components/pipelines/ ❌ UI components built for orchestration\n  6. src/v2/pages/ ❌ Pages expecting orchestration features\n\n  Current Problems:\n\n  // usePipelines.ts - BROKEN ENDPOINTS\n  GET /projects/{projectId}/pipelines  // ❌ Doesn't exist\n  GET /pipelines/{pipelineId}          // ❌ Doesn't exist\n\n  // usePipelineActions.ts - BROKEN ENDPOINTS  \n  POST /pipelines/{id}/start           // ❌ Doesn't exist\n  POST /pipelines/{id}/stop            // ❌ Doesn't exist\n  POST /pipelines/{id}/pause           // ❌ Doesn't exist\n  POST /pipelines/{id}/resume          // ❌ Doesn't exist\n  POST /pipelines/{id}/restart         // ❌ Doesn't exist\n\n  // useRuns.ts - BROKEN ENDPOINTS\n  GET /pipelines/{id}/runs             // ❌ Doesn't exist\n  DELETE /pipelines/{id}/runs/{runId}  // ❌ Doesn't exist\n\n  Task: Simplify Week 6 to Match Backend\n\n  Phase 1: Update API Integration\n\n  1. Fix src/v2/hooks/api/usePipelines.ts\n    - Replace fetchPipelinesByProject() to use filterPipelineList({ project: projectId })\n    - Replace fetchPipelineDetail() to use filterPipelineGet(id)\n    - Update return types to use generated FilterPipeline type instead of custom\n  PipelineDetail\n  2. Simplify src/v2/types/pipeline.ts\n    - Keep only types that match backend reality\n    - Remove: PipelineConfig, PipelineTrigger, PipelineMetrics, PipelineStats, PipelineRun,\n  PipelineRunStatus\n    - Map frontend types to backend FilterPipeline type\n    - Consider aliasing: type Pipeline = FilterPipeline\n  3. Remove broken hooks:\n    - Delete or stub out src/v2/hooks/api/useRuns.ts (no runs tracking in backend)\n    - Remove pipeline control actions from usePipelineActions.ts: start, stop, pause, resume,\n  restart\n\n  Phase 2: Simplify UI Components\n\n  4. Update src/v2/components/pipelines/PipelineCreationWizard.tsx\n    - Remove multi-step wizard (Configuration, Triggers steps)\n    - Keep only: Basic Info step (name, description, project)\n    - Remove form fields: tags, source config, model config, filters, outputs, triggers\n    - Simplify to single-page form: name (required), description (optional)\n  5. Update src/v2/components/pipelines/PipelineControls.tsx\n    - Remove: Start, Stop, Pause, Resume, Restart buttons\n    - Keep only: Edit, Delete buttons\n    - Remove status indicators (idle, running, paused, etc.)\n  6. Update src/v2/components/pipelines/PipelineOverviewCard.tsx\n    - Display: name, description, BigQuery dataset name, created date, updated date\n    - Remove: status badge, metrics, last run info, next run info, trigger info\n  7. Update pipeline list components\n    - Remove: Status column, Metrics column, Last Run column, Actions column (start/stop)\n    - Keep: Name, Description, Created, Updated, Actions (edit/delete)\n\n  Phase 3: Update Pages\n\n  8. Update src/v2/pages/PipelineDashboardPage.tsx\n    - Remove: Runs history, Metrics charts, Stats cards\n    - Show: Pipeline details (name, description, dataset), Event ingestion info\n    - Add: \"View in BigQuery\" link (if dataset exists)\n    - Consider adding: Event ingestion instructions/documentation\n  9. Update src/v2/pages/PipelinesListPage.tsx\n    - Update to use simplified list component\n    - Remove: Bulk actions (start/stop), Status filters\n    - Keep: Create new pipeline, Search/filter by name, Delete\n  10. Update src/v2/pages/PipelineCreationPage.tsx\n    - Use simplified creation form\n    - Remove: Multi-step wizard navigation\n\n  Phase 4: Update Form Types\n\n  11. Simplify src/v2/types/pipelineCreation.ts\n    - Remove: configuration step, triggers step\n    - Keep only: basicInfo with name, description, projectId, organizationId\n    - Match to backend FilterPipelineCreate schema\n\n  Testing Checklist\n\n  After updates, verify:\n  - Can list pipelines for a project\n  - Can create a new pipeline (name + description)\n  - Can view pipeline details (shows BigQuery dataset name)\n  - Can update pipeline description\n  - Can delete pipeline\n  - No TypeScript errors\n  - No console errors about missing endpoints\n  - Dev server runs without errors\n\n  Generated API Client Already Available\n\n  These are already imported and working:\n\n  import {\n    filterPipelineList,\n    filterPipelineGet,\n    filterPipelineCreate,\n    filterPipelineUpdate,\n    filterPipelineDelete,\n    filterPipelineIngestEvents,\n    filterPipelineValidateDataset,\n    // React Query hooks:\n    useFilterPipelineList,\n    useFilterPipelineGet,\n    useFilterPipelineCreate,\n    useFilterPipelineUpdate,\n    useFilterPipelineDelete,\n    useFilterPipelineIngestEvents,\n    useFilterPipelineValidateDataset,\n  } from '@/api/generated/filter-pipelines/filter-pipelines';\n\n  import type {\n    FilterPipeline,\n    FilterPipelineCreate,\n    FilterPipelineUpdate,\n  } from '@/api/generated/plainsightAPI.schemas';\n\n  Success Criteria\n\n  1. ✅ All API calls use existing /filter-pipelines endpoints\n  2. ✅ UI matches backend capabilities (CRUD only)\n  3. ✅ No references to non-existent orchestration features\n  4. ✅ TypeScript compiles with zero errors\n  5. ✅ Dev server runs cleanly\n  6. ✅ Can perform all CRUD operations on pipelines\n\n  Notes\n\n  - The Week 6 code is in /Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight/client-portal/src/v2/\n  - API client already generated and working\n  - Focus on simplification, not adding features\n  - Keep UI clean and focused on data pipeline management\n  - Consider this a \"data collection pipeline manager\" not a \"CV pipeline orchestrator\"","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1762774976838,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight","sessionId":"ce43bee8-8dd6-4b92-85a3-4d2ae7367472"}

{"display":"  Context\n\n  We've completed the v2 foundation (navigation, search, keyboard shortcuts) and simplified\n  the Pipeline UI to match the backend reality (basic CRUD for BigQuery filter pipelines).\n  Week 8 should focus on Model Management and Training Workflows, which are core features of\n  the Plainsight platform.\n\n  Current State\n\n  - ✅ Week 5: v2 foundation with navigation, search, shortcuts\n  - ✅ Week 6: Pipeline CRUD (simplified to FilterPipeline API)\n  - ⏭️ Week 7: Notifications & Settings (skipped for now)\n  - 🎯 Week 8: Model Management & Training Workflows\n\n  Backend APIs Available\n\n  Based on the plainsight-api structure, we should have access to:\n  - /models - Model CRUD operations\n  - /trainings - Training job management\n  - /training-runs - Training execution tracking\n  - Model versioning and deployment endpoints\n\n  Week 8 Goals\n\n  1. Model List & Detail Pages\n\n  - ModelsListPage - Browse all models with filtering/search\n    - Table view with model name, version, status, accuracy metrics\n    - Filter by project, status (draft, training, deployed, archived)\n    - Bulk actions (deploy, archive, delete)\n  - ModelDashboardPage - Model detail view\n    - Model overview card (version, created date, training data info)\n    - Performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall)\n    - Training history timeline\n    - Deployment status and endpoints\n    - Model controls (deploy, retrain, archive, delete)\n\n  2. Training Workflow\n\n  - TrainingCreationPage - Start new training job\n    - Single-page form (similar to PipelineCreationWizard approach)\n    - Select base model or create new\n    - Dataset selection (connect to existing pipeline data)\n    - Training configuration (epochs, batch size, learning rate)\n    - Validation: ensure all required fields before submission\n  - TrainingDashboardPage - Monitor active training\n    - Real-time progress bar and metrics\n    - Training logs viewer\n    - Loss/accuracy charts (if available from API)\n    - Cancel training action with confirmation\n    - Training history table\n\n  3. Components to Build\n\n  - ModelOverviewCard.tsx - Model summary with version info\n  - ModelMetricsCard.tsx - Performance metrics display\n  - TrainingProgressCard.tsx - Live training status\n  - TrainingHistoryTable.tsx - Past training runs\n  - TrainingConfigForm.tsx - Training parameters form\n  - ModelControls.tsx - Action buttons (deploy, archive, etc)\n  - ModelStatusBadge.tsx - Visual status indicator\n\n  4. API Integration\n\n  - useModels.ts - Fetch models with React Query\n  - useModel(id) - Single model detail\n  - useModelsByProject(id) - Filter by project\n  - useTrainings.ts - Training jobs list\n  - useTraining(id) - Training detail with live updates\n  - useModelActions.ts - Deploy, archive, delete mutations\n  - useTrainingActions.ts - Start, cancel, retry mutations\n\n  5. Type Definitions\n\n  Update src/v2/types/ with:\n  - model.ts - Model, ModelVersion, ModelStatus types\n  - training.ts - Training, TrainingConfig, TrainingMetrics types\n  - Match actual backend API schemas (use generated types if available)\n\n  Key Requirements\n\n  1. Align with Backend Reality\n    - Use actual API endpoints from plainsight-api\n    - Don't assume features that don't exist in the backend\n    - Verify API schemas before implementing UI\n  2. Follow Established Patterns\n    - Use semantic tokens for all colors (surface., text., interactive.*)\n    - Single-page forms (not multi-step wizards)\n    - Centralized useNotificationCenter for all user feedback\n    - Confirmation dialogs for dangerous operations\n    - React Query for all data fetching\n    - Zustand only if new global state is needed\n  3. Build Quality\n    - Zero TypeScript errors on build\n    - Proper loading states with skeleton components\n    - Error handling with retry actions\n    - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)\n  4. Testing\n    - Unit tests for new components (follow existing patterns)\n    - E2E tests for critical paths (model creation, training start)\n    - Maintain 100% test pass rate\n\n  Deliverables\n\n  1. Model list and detail pages with full CRUD\n  2. Training workflow (create, monitor, cancel)\n  3. All necessary components and hooks\n  4. Type-safe API integration\n  5.

{"display":"\n⏺ Here's a comprehensive prompt for the next session:\n\n  # Task: Add Quick Actions to Sidebar for Creating Resources\n\n  ## Context\n  We have a sidebar in the client-portal v2 interface with quick action buttons. We need to\n  add three new quick actions:\n  1. Schedule Training\n  2. Create Project\n  3. Create Model\n\n  ## Current State\n  - Quick actions currently exist in `src/v2/components/sidebar/QuickActionsSection.tsx`\n  - We have existing modal components for creating these resources\n  - Modals are likely in `src/v2/components/modals/` directory\n\n  ## Requirements\n\n  ### 1. Add Quick Actions to Sidebar\n  Add three new buttons to the QuickActionsSection component:\n  - **Schedule Training** - icon: HiPlay, purple color\n  - **Create Project** - icon: HiPlus, blue color\n  - **Create Model** - icon: HiDatabase, green color\n\n  ### 2. Extend Modal Components\n\n  #### Project Creation Modal\n  - Should accept optional `organizationId` prop\n  - When opened from sidebar: use current organization from context\n  - When opened from project details page: still infer from context\n  - Path: Likely `src/v2/components/modals/ProjectCreationModal.tsx`\n\n  #### Model Creation Modal\n  - Should accept optional `projectId` prop\n  - When opened from sidebar: show \"Select Project\" dropdown field\n  - When opened from project details page: auto-fill and hide the project selector (infer from\n   route params)\n  - Path: Likely `src/v2/components/modals/ModelCreationModal.tsx` or similar\n\n  #### Training Creation Modal\n  - Should accept optional `modelId` prop\n  - When opened from sidebar: show \"Select Model\" dropdown field\n  - When opened from project/model details page: auto-fill and hide the model selector (infer\n  from route params)\n  - Path: Might be `src/v2/components/modals/TrainingCreationModal.tsx` or\n  `StartTrainingModal.tsx`\n\n  ### 3. Context Detection\n  - Use `useNavigationContext()` from `@/stores/navigationStore` to get current organization\n  - Use `useParams()` from `@tanstack/react-router` to detect current project/model when on\n  detail pages\n  - Use existing hooks like `useProject()`, `useModelsByProject()`, etc. from\n  `src/v2/hooks/api/` for dropdown data\n\n  ### 4. Dropdown Data\n  - **Select Project dropdown**: Fetch using `useProjectsByOrganization(organizationId)` or\n  similar\n  - **Select Model dropdown**: Fetch using `useModelsByProject(projectId)` or similar, but\n  when opened from sidebar without project context, might need to fetch all models for the org\n\n  ## Files to Check/Modify\n  1. `src/v2/components/sidebar/QuickActionsSection.tsx` - Add new action buttons\n  2. `src/v2/components/modals/ProjectCreationModal.tsx` (or similar) - Add organizationId\n  prop support\n  3. `src/v2/components/modals/` - Find and update Model creation modal\n  4. `src/v2/components/modals/` - Find and update Training creation modal\n  5. Check existing modal usage in `src/v2/pages/ProjectDashboardPage.tsx` for reference\n\n  ## Implementation Strategy\n  1. First, locate all existing modal components\n  2. Update each modal to accept optional context props (organizationId, projectId, modelId)\n  3. Add conditional rendering for dropdowns when context is missing\n  4. Update QuickActionsSection to use modals with proper context\n  5. Ensure modals work correctly both from sidebar (partial context) and detail pages (full\n  context)\n\n  ## Design Considerations\n  - Modals should use Chakra UI components and semantic tokens\n  - Follow existing patterns in the codebase (see PipelineCreationModal for reference)\n  - Dropdowns should show loading states while fetching data\n  - Dropdowns should handle empty states (no projects/models available)\n  - Use existing API hooks from `src/v2/hooks/api/`\n\n  ## Testing Points\n  - Opening modals from sidebar (global context)\n  - Opening modals from project detail page (project context)\n  - Opening modals from model detail page (full context)\n  - Dropdown population and selection\n  - Form validation and submission\n\n  This prompt provides all the context needed to implement the feature in a new session!","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1762901852954,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/work/plainsight","sessionId":"8f5a9787-748c-4bc6-9bda-66b4d1dd7ed5"}

{"display":"Task: Migrate Filters Feature to Client Portal v2\n\n  Context\n\n  The client-portal currently has a Filters feature in v1 that needs to be migrated to the new\n   v2 architecture. This migration should follow all v2 patterns and architectural decisions\n  while maintaining feature parity with v1.\n\n  Current V1 State\n\n  Files to Investigate\n\n  1. V1 Filter Components: Look in src/components/filters/ or similar\n  2. V1 Filter Pages: Check src/pages/ for filter-related pages\n  3. V1 Filter API: Check src/lib/api/ or src/api/ for filter endpoints\n  4. V1 Filter Types: Look for filter type definitions in src/types/\n  5. V1 Filter Routes: Check router configuration for filter routes\n\n  Questions to Answer During Exploration\n\n  - What does the Filters feature do?\n  - What are the main pages/views (list, detail, creation, editing)?\n  - What API endpoints are used?\n  - What actions can users perform (create, edit, delete, deploy, etc.)?\n  - Are there any complex workflows or state machines?\n  - What data models are involved?\n\n  V2 Migration Requirements\n\n  1. Architecture Compliance\n\n  Follow V2 Patterns:\n  - Routing: Use TanStack Router with type-safe routes\n    - Pattern: /v2/organizations/$organizationId/projects/$projectId/filters\n    - Pattern: /v2/organizations/$organizationId/projects/$projectId/filters/$filterId\n  - State Management:\n    - Use Zustand for client state if needed\n    - Use React Query hooks for server state\n    - Use useNavigationContext() for navigation state\n  - API Integration:\n    - Create hooks in src/v2/hooks/api/useFilters.ts (or similar)\n    - Use Orval-generated API clients if available\n    - Follow patterns from useProjectQueries.ts, useModelQueries.ts\n  - Design System:\n    - Use semantic tokens exclusively (no useColorModeValue)\n    - Use Chakra UI components\n    - Follow ProjectCreationModal, ModelCreationModal patterns for modals\n\n  2. Page Structure\n\n  Create V2 Pages:\n  src/v2/pages/\n    ├── FiltersListPage.tsx          # List all filters in a project\n    ├── FilterDetailPage.tsx         # Filter detail/overview\n    ├── FilterCreationPage.tsx       # Create new filter (if complex form)\n    └── FilterEditPage.tsx           # Edit filter (if needed)\n\n  Create V2 Components:\n  src/v2/components/filters/\n    ├── FilterCard.tsx               # Filter card for list view\n    ├── FilterStats.tsx              # Filter statistics/metrics\n    ├── FilterActions.tsx            # Action buttons (deploy, delete, etc.)\n    └── FilterConfigForm.tsx         # Filter configuration form\n\n  Create V2 Modals (if applicable):\n  src/v2/components/modals/\n    ├── FilterCreationModal.tsx      # Quick filter creation\n    ├── FilterDeployModal.tsx        # Deploy filter modal\n    └── FilterDeleteModal.tsx        # Delete confirmation\n\n  3. Navigation Integration\n\n  Add to Navigation Tree:\n  - Update src/stores/navigationStore.ts to include filters in the navigation tree\n  - Filters should appear under their parent project\n  - Pattern: Organization > Project > Filters\n\n  Add to Sidebar:\n  - Consider adding \"Create Filter\" to QuickActionsSection\n  - Follow the pattern used for Create Project, Create Model, etc.\n\n  Add Breadcrumbs:\n  - Ensure breadcrumbs work for filter pages\n  - Pattern: Organization > Project > Filters > Filter Name\n\n  4. API Integration\n\n  Create API Hooks (src/v2/hooks/api/useFilters.ts):\n  // Following patterns from useModels.ts, useProjects.ts\n\n  export function useFiltersByProject(projectId?: string)\n  export function useFilter(filterId?: string)\n  export function useCreateFilter()\n  export function useUpdateFilter(filterId?: string)\n  export function useDeleteFilter()\n  export function useDeployFilter()  // If filters can be deployed\n\n  Query Keys (update src/v2/hooks/api/queryKeys.ts):\n  filters: {\n    all: ['filters'] as const,\n    lists: () => [...queryKeys.filters.all, 'list'] as const,\n    list: (filters: unknown) => [...queryKeys.filters.lists(), filters] as const,\n    byProject: (projectId: string) => [...queryKeys.filters.all, 'byProject', projectId] as\n  const,\n    details: () => [...queryKeys.filters.all, 'detail'] as const,\n    detail: (filterId: string) => [...queryKeys.filters.details(), filterId] as const,\n  },\n\n  5. Route Configuration\n\n  Add Routes (update src/routeTree.gen.ts or route configuration):\n  // Filters list route\n  '/v2/organizations/$organizationId/projects/$projectId/filters'\n\n  // Filter detail route\n  '/v2/organizations/$organizationId/projects/$projectId/filters/$filterId'\n\n  // Filter creation route (if full page, not modal)\n  '/v2/organizations/$organizationId/projects/$projectId/filters/new'\n\n  6. Notification Integration\n\n  Use Notification Center:\n  - Use useNotificationCenter() for all user feedback\n  - Follow 5 error categories: network, validation, permission, system, business\n  - Examples:\n  // Loading\n  const loadingId = notifications.loading('Creating filter...', {\n    message: 'Setting up filter configuration',\n    persistent: true\n  });\n\n  // Success\n  notifications.success('Filter created', `\"${filterName}\" is ready to use`);\n\n  // Error with category\n  notifications.error('Filter creation failed', 'validation', errorMessage);\n\n  7. Design System Compliance\n\n  Semantic Tokens:\n  - surface.* - backgrounds (surface.raised, surface.hover, surface.subtle)\n  - text.* - text colors (text.primary, text.secondary, text.muted)\n  - interactive.* - interactive elements (interactive.primary, interactive.surface,\n  interactive.border)\n  - border.* - borders (border.subtle, border.strong)\n  - input.* - form inputs (input.bg, input.border, input.borderHover)\n  - status.* - status colors (status.success, status.warning, status.error, status.info)\n\n  Component Patterns:\n  - Follow ProjectDashboardPage.tsx for dashboard layouts\n  - Follow ProjectCreationModal.tsx for modal patterns\n  - Follow ModelCreationModal.tsx for forms with conditional fields\n  - Use HStack, VStack, Grid for layouts\n  - Use Card, CardHeader, CardBody for card layouts\n\n  8. Testing Requirements\n\n  After Implementation:\n  - Ensure dev server runs without errors\n  - Test all filter CRUD operations\n  - Test navigation between filter pages\n  - Test breadcrumbs and sidebar navigation\n  - Test with and without project context\n  - Test error states and loading states\n\n  Implementation Strategy\n\n  Phase 1: Discovery\n\n  1. Use the Explore agent to find all V1 filter-related files\n  2. Read and understand V1 filter implementation\n  3. Identify API endpoints and data models\n  4. Document key workflows and features\n\n  Phase 2: API Layer\n\n  1. Check if Orval-generated clients exist for filters\n  2. Create useFilters.ts hooks file\n  3. Add filter query keys\n  4. Implement all CRUD hooks following existing patterns\n\n  Phase 3: Pages\n\n  1. Create FiltersListPage (project's filters overview)\n  2. Create FilterDetailPage (individual filter view)\n  3. Create FilterCreationPage or FilterCreationModal\n  4. Add routes to router configuration\n\n  Phase 4: Navigation\n\n  1. Update navigationStore to include filters\n  2.

{"display":"Phase 1: Add Parent-Child Offerings Support\n\n  Context\n\n  Project: The Well - Nuxt.js 2 + Sanity CMS wellness platform\n\n  Current State:\n  - We have an /offerings route with index and detail pages (/offerings/_slug.vue)\n  - Offerings are standalone documents in Sanity\n  - We need to support nested offering relationships (e.g., \"Wellness Packages\" parent with\n  \"Detox Retreat\" child)\n\n  Architectural Decision:\n  We're using Sanity references (not nested routes) to create parent-child relationships. This\n   avoids creating physical nested routes like /offerings/_parent/_slug.vue and maintains a\n  simpler, more scalable architecture.\n\n  Tasks to Complete\n\n  1. Update Offering Schema (CMS)\n\n  File: /the-well-cms/schemas/offerings/_offering.js\n\n  Add a parentOffering reference field:\n\n  {\n    name: 'parentOffering',\n    title: 'Parent Offering (Optional)',\n    type: 'reference',\n    to: [{type: 'offering'}],\n    description: 'Link this offering to a parent offering to create a hierarchy (e.g., \"Detox \n  Retreat\" under \"Wellness Packages\")'\n  }\n\n  Placement: Add this field after category or before modules, wherever makes sense in the\n  schema structure.\n\n  2. Update Offering Query (Client)\n\n  File: /the-well-client/queries/offerings/_offering.js\n\n  Update the query to fetch parent offering data:\n\n  parentOffering->{\n    _id,\n    name,\n    slug,\n    shortDescription\n  }\n\n  This allows us to display parent information in breadcrumbs and links.\n\n  3. Add Breadcrumb Support\n\n  File: /the-well-client/pages/offerings/_slug.vue\n\n  Add breadcrumb generation based on parent-child relationships:\n\n  computed: {\n    breadcrumbs() {\n      const crumbs = [\n        { text: 'Home', url: '/' },\n        { text: 'Offerings', url: '/offerings' }\n      ]\n\n      if (this.content.parentOffering) {\n        crumbs.push({\n          text: this.content.parentOffering.name,\n          url: `/offerings/${this.content.parentOffering.slug.current || \n  this.content.parentOffering.slug}`\n        })\n      }\n\n      crumbs.push({\n        text: this.content.name,\n        url: null // Current page\n      })\n\n      return crumbs\n    }\n  }\n\n  Then pass breadcrumbs to the SmallHeroWithBreadcrumbs module or create a breadcrumb\n  component.\n\n  4. Optional: Update Offerings Index Page\n\n  File: /the-well-client/pages/offerings/index.vue\n\n  Consider grouping offerings by parent or filtering to show only parent offerings on the\n  index page.\n\n  Files to Review/Modify\n\n  CMS (/the-well-cms):\n  - schemas/offerings/_offering.js - Add parentOffering field\n\n  Client (/the-well-client):\n  - queries/offerings/_offering.js - Update query to include parent data\n  - pages/offerings/_slug.vue - Add breadcrumb computed property\n  - Optionally create components/core/Breadcrumb.vue if one doesn't exist\n\n  Success Criteria\n\n  - ✅ In Sanity Studio, editors can select a parent offering when creating/editing an\n  offering\n  - ✅ Offering detail pages show breadcrumbs: Home > Offerings > Parent Offering > Current\n  Offering\n  - ✅ Parent offering link in breadcrumb navigates correctly\n  - ✅ Build completes without errors\n  - ✅ Works for both parent offerings (no parent) and child offerings (with parent)\n\n  Testing Checklist\n\n  1. Create a parent offering (e.g., \"Wellness Packages\")\n  2. Create a child offering that references the parent (e.g., \"Detox Retreat\")\n  3. Navigate to child offering page\n  4. Verify breadcrumb shows full hierarchy\n  5. Click parent offering in breadcrumb, verify navigation works\n  6. Test parent offering page (should work normally without parent breadcrumb)\n\n  Notes\n\n  - Keep existing offering functionality intact\n  - This should be additive, not breaking changes\n  - Parent-child relationship is optional (backwards compatible)\n  - Follow existing code patterns in the project (check CLAUDE.md files)\n\n  ---\n  When ready, start with: \"Let's implement Phase 1 of the parent-child offerings support. I'll\n   begin by updating the offering schema to add the parentOffering reference field.\"","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1763136564024,"project":"/Users/helrabelo/code/work/planetary/the-well","sessionId":"91de3222-fb5f-4af2-8d63-7ede2866bd2f"}
